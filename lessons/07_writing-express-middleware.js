Writing Express middleware
_Congratulations! _tadatadatada

You finished the course. You can now make a basic JSON server using Express and NodeJS! You're kind of like a wizard! mage But you have only scratched the surface.

--------------------------------

Learn More Express
The best place to see what's possible with Express is on its official website.
https://expressjs.com/

If you want to...

- Organize the calls to Express learn more about middleware

- Build a web backend instead of the JSON example here, use a template engine
https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html

- Store data from your users, you'll need a database
Of course, Express is only one way to use Node...

If you want to...

- Make a basic Node server to see the difference from Express, see Node's hello world
https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/

- Learn some fundamentals of Node, you can dig into debugging
https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/

- Extend Node's functionality, look into modules
https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html
